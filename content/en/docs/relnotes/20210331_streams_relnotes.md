It is important, especially when upgrading from an earlier version, to be aware of the following changes in the behavior or operation of the product in this new version.

### Streams REST APIs

The following changes have been made to the Streams Rest APIs to fully comply with Axway Rest API Guidelines:

#### New Rest API Paths

| Webhook Subscriber | /subscribers/webhook | /streams/subscribers/webhook/api/v1 |

| HTTP Post Publisher | /publishers/http-post | /streams/publishers/http-post/api/v1 |

#### Pagination

Links related to [pagination](/docs/topics-api/#Pagination) are now provided as part of the response body.

#### Json Object as root element of the response body

Streams Rest APIs no longer return an `array` as root element of the response.
APIs returning a list of elements now return a JSON Object as root element and an `array` wrapped in `items` attribute.
