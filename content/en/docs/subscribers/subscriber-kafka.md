Streams Kafka subscriber allows clients to route events published in a Streams topic to an external Kafka topic.

## Creating a Kafka subscription

You can create a kafka subscription by making an HTTP Post request on the following endpoint:

```
POST /streams/subscribers/kafka/api/v1/topics/{topicID}/subscriptions
```

The body must contain a JSON kafka subscription configuration as the following example:

```json
{
    "subscriptionMode": "snapshot-only",
    "bootstrapServers": "my-kafka-cluster:9092",
    "topic": "kafka-topic-to-publish-to",
    "partition": 0,
    "recordKey": "optional-custom-record-key"
}
```

| Configuration Entry | Mandatory | Default value | Description |
|---------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| subscriptionMode | no | Default subscription mode defined in the topic's configuration | For more information, see [subscription modes](/docs/subscribers/#subscription-modes). |
| bootstrapServers | yes | n/a | List of Kafka servers used to bootstrap connections to Kafka. |
| topic | yes | n/a | Kafka topic in which a record must be sent. |
| partition | no | n/a | Kafka partition to use. |
| recordKey | no | topic id | Record key to use for each sent record. If not set, the `topicId` is used. |

After the kafka subscription is successfully created, Streams start sending records to your kafka cluster.

### Create status codes

The following are HTTP status codes that can be returned when trying to create a kafka subscription:

| Code | Comment |
|------|---------|
| 201 Created | Indicates that the subscription request is valid and has been created. |
| 400 Bad Request | Indicates that the provided data is invalid. |
| 404 Not found | Indicates that the requested URL does not exist. |

## Stop a kafka subscription

To stop sending records to your kafka cluster, delete the corresponding kafka subscription with the following request:

```
DELETE /streams/subscribers/kafka/api/v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}
```

### Delete status codes

The following are HTTP status codes that can be returned when deleting the kafka subscription:

| Code | Comment |
|------|---------|
| 204 No Content | Indicates that the subscription has been successfully deleted.
| 404 Not found | Indicates that the provided identifier does not correspond to an existing kafka subscription.

## Getting a kafka subscription

To get an existing subscription, use the following GET request:

```
GET /streams/subscribers/kafka/api/v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}
```

### Get status codes

| 404 Not found | Indicates that the requested URL or subscription requested does not exist. |

## Testing a Kafka subscription

You can test a Kafka subscription by making an HTTP Post request on the following endpoint:

```
POST /streams/subscribers/kafka/api/v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/test
```

The request body can contain any JSON object and it will be sent as-is to the identified subscription.

### Test status codes

The following HTTP status codes can be returned while testing a Kafka subscription:

| Code | Comment |
|------|---------|
| 202 Accepted | Indicates that the payload has been successfully sent to the subscription. |
| 400 Bad Request | Indicates that the provided data are invalid. |
| 404 Not found | Indicates that the requested URL does not exist. |

## Get kafka subscriptions for a topic

Use the following HTTP Get request on your topic to get existing subscriptions:

```
GET /streams/subscribers/kafka/api/v1/topics/{topicId}/subscriptions
```

For more information on how pagination and sorting work, see [Pagination](/docs/topics-api/#pagination).

The field names allowed for sorting are:

* subscriptionMode
* kafkaBootstrapServers
* kafkaTopic
* kafkaPartition
* kafkaRecordKey

## Kafka record

As soon as the publisher starts to publish data, the kafka subscribers start to receive the message, and they send a record with custom headers and a payload.

### Record headers

| Header name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| X-Axway-Streams-Subscription-Id | Unique identifier of the kafka subscription. |
| X-Axway-Streams-Topic-Id | Identifier of the topic to which the subscription belongs. |
| X-Axway-Streams-Event-Id | Identifier of the event. |
| X-Axway-Streams-Event-Type | Type of the payload (snapshot, patch or error). |

#### Record Payload

Refer to [subscription modes](/docs/subscribers/#subscription-modes) and [subscription error](/docs/subscribers/subscribers-errors/) section for more details.
